# INFO6150 Week 8 Assignments

Due by the beginning of class, week 10 (March 11).

This week you will be practicing adding an adaptive layout to your components from last week.

## create a week-8 branch from your week-7 branch
You will be using the components you created last week for this week's assignment.

```
cd seainfo6150-webapp
git checkout week-7
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b week-8
```

## add media queries
Create media queries for week 8's assignment to make it adaptive as well as responsive. You may add whatever breakpoints and flex/shuffle the layout as you like, but there must be at least 3 breakpoints and your layout must demonstrate good principles of usability. For example, think about readability in terms of line length, font sizes, etc. 

## start the webapp

Start the webapp and verify that your layout is both responsive and adaptive.

```
npm start
```

## save it

save and commit your work to the week-9 branch and push to your fork

```
git add .
git commit -m "[your commit message]"
git push origin week-8
```

## send an email 
Send an email to Tianyu (20spr.info6150@gmail.com) with a link to your seainfo6150-webapp fork.
