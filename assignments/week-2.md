# INFO6150 Week 2 Assignments
Due by the beginning of class, week 3 (September 18).
You may revise once by the beginning of class, week 4 (September 25).

1.  Choose a website that evokes a certain “look and feel” as we discussed in lecture. Some examples might be "playful", “sophisticated”, “bold”, etc.

List the website, the "look and feel" words that you think the website evokes and an explanation of your choice with principles discussed in lecture.

2. Create a wireframe of the homepage you chose for question 1. You can use the http://framebox.org tool demonstrated in class or any other tool you like (Photoshop, Invision, pen and paper, etc.)

Send an email to Yiwei (luo.yiw@husky.neu.edu) with your work for #1 and #2.
